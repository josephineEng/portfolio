This is a clear sign of a lady who's passionate about what she does, a man who is curious about anything and everything, a lady who doesn't quit until she succeeds. A hardworker by the definition, Bonka Josephine is a joy to work with, sometimes she might need someone to step on the brakes, but most people need someone to step on the gas, and I'd say having too much speed in your field has very little cons and way too many pros.",
